	abstract = {We propose a combination of methods for processing multitemporal multispectral satellite images to identify variations in vegetation indices for fixed regions across time to analyze deforestation in Peru. The images, taken from a location in Ucayali, Peru, are obtained from public repositories for Sentinel-2 satellite, which covers up to 13 spectral band layers with spatial resolutions of 10, 20, and 60 m and have a temporal resolution of 5 days with the same angle vision. We preprocessed the images for cloud and river removal and normalization to apply the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). All images were segmented with their corresponding model, leading to the analysis of the variance of this segmentation information across different time frames for a single location in which the normalized difference of time series (NDTS) was obtained for each year. Finally, a first approach was built for a linear regression model that could segment each frame into sectors, according to vegetation density, using the multispectral features as parameters. For the selected location, the results show an increment from about 4200 ha in 2018 to about 8200 in 2020.},

	abstract = {India had announced the longest ever lockdown from 25 March 2020 to 14 April 2020 amid COVID-19 pandemic. It was reported that the water quality of the Ganga River has improved as compared to regular during this country-wide lockdown. In the present study, an attempt has been made to study the change in water quality of the river in terms of turbidity purely through remote sensing data, in the absence of ground observations, especially during this time period. The change in spectral reflectance of water along the river in the visible region has been analyzed using the Sentinel-2 multispectral remote sensing data at Haridwar, Kanpur, Prayagraj, and Varanasi stretches of the river. In the present study, it was found that the red and NIR bands are most sensitive, and can be used to estimate the turbidity. Further, the temporal variation in turbidity was also analyzed through normalized difference turbidity index at each location. It was observed that the turbidity in the river has reduced drastically at each stretch of the river. The study elicited that the remote sensing approach can be used to make qualitative estimates on turbidity, even in the absence of field observations.},
